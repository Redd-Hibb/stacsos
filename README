Notes on the P3 submission
==========================

To easily view the changes to the code i made, look at the commit named:

"Submission - All changes were made in one commit so that they can easily viewed"

(not to be confused with the merge named "Submission", oops)


Though some minor changes were made before then, all the major changes were pushed in that commit.

To get started, try:

  $ make run

You may need to coerce QEMU and the display variable, e.g.:

  $ make run qemu=/usr/bin/my-qemu qemu-display=sdl

Or, if you just build it (with make), the output files will be written to the
out/ directory - so you can try booting it manually!

Once running in the shell, try running the Mandelbrot program:

  > /usr/mandelbrot

(the shell is extremely basic, and does not support path resolution)
